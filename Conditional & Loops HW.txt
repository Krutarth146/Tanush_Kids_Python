1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiples of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).
 

2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius and Fahrenheit.
[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
Expected Output :
60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45°F is 7 in Celsius
 

3. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 and 9.
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.
 

4. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* *

5. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverses it.
 

8. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
Note : Use 'continue' statement.
Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5
 

9. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50.
Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
 

10. Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output :
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
 


13. Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input. The program will print the numbers that are divisible by 5 in a comma separated sequence.
Sample Data : 0100,0011,1010,1001,1100,1001
Expected Output : 1010
 

14. Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculates the number of digits and letters.
Sample Data : Python 3.2
Expected Output :
Letters 6
Digits 2

 

15. Write a Python program to check the validity of passwords input by users.
Validation :

At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
At least 1 number between [0-9].
At least 1 character from [$#@].
Minimum length 6 characters.
Maximum length 16 characters.
 

16. Write a Python program to find numbers between 100 and 400 (both included) where each digit of a number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence.
